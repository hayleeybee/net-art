    Parakeets are absolutely lovely. I owned two of them while growing up; 
    they are so small and have the most beautiful colors, and they are also affectionate. 
    I think it's sweet that they prefer to be together, reflecting their social nature.
    They are the sweetest and cutest little guys around.
