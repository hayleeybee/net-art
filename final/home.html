  <p> You wake up in your childhood home's bed. 
    Everything is just as you left it.
    The light shines through your window the way it always has.
    You blink a few times, trying to shake off the remnants of your mid-afternoon nap, your head still hazy from the embrace of sleep.
    The familiar sensations envelope you like the warmest of blankets.
    You hear the faint sound of a train horn and birds singing through your open window, prompting you to return back to your dreams.

    i love being at home
    <br>
    <br>
    and sleeping inside my home
    <br>
    <br>
    and staying home
    <br>
