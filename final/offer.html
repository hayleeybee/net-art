  <p> The geese are so thrilled they waddled around in excitement and then put on a show to repay you.
    You discover they are quite talented at forming an orchestra, using their honks to create music.
    After a while, you're ready to leave the marsh with music in your ears and the love of feathered friends in your heart.
    The geese are happy to walk you to wherever you please.
