<p>Suddenly the garden path you've been walking along for quite a while comes to an end. 
    You look up to see a mirror-shaped archway, revealing a shimmering, vibrant forest within. 
    As you step closer, the archway ripples like water and you're fully immersed in this new world. 
    The air is filled with the sweet smell of lush overgrowth and eternal summer.
    You can hear the buzz and hum of creatures in the distance.

    Past the entrance, you notice the trees diverge to form three distinct paths. Where to next?
