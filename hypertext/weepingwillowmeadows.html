  <p> Warm light floods through the canopy of trees above you. 
    The breeze blows the slender branches of hundreds of willow trees softly in the wind.
    The dirt path and grass floor quickly turns into an endless flower bed of wild thyme and lavender.
    The hazy warmth takes away a lifetime of worries.
    As you debate on taking a nap at the base of the tallest willow you could see, a bunny with dragonfly wings approaches shyly, iridescent wings sparkling.
