<h1>On Loving Bugs</h1>
  <p>I don't think learning to love bugs with all your heart means forcing yourself out of discomfort you have with them overnight. 
<ul>
  <li>It's about observing a different sort of being going about its life and deliberately trying to reframe your observations through a sense of wonder and delight.</li> 
  <li>It's about cultivating a positive interest and curiosity for their ecology and behaviors.</li> 
  <li>It's especially about trying to uncouple the value we find in them from how 'convenient' they are to us; 
  to face head on the part of us that wants to assign moral evil to another organism who just happens to live life in a way that is not harmonious with ours.</li>
</ul>
  You can love insects in this way and still recognize your own health and safety needs. 
  We are animals living side by side within a biosphere. This is how it is, sometimes.

  <br>
  
  I think this is important to cultivate because, 
<ol>
  <li>if you are alive at all, you are coming into conflict with countless other people and things that don't owe you an apology for their existence and needs.</li>
  <li>If you are alive at all, you are encountering countless other people and things that harmful bias and personal discomfort have made repulsive to you.</li>
</ol>

  <b>This is about bugs, &nbsp;  but it's also about <em>way more</em> than bugs.</b></p>
