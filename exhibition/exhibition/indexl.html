            <p>
                The internet and video games have long been spaces of play, creativity, and nostalgia. With this project, 
                I intend to explore the aesthetics and emotions tied to early digital experiences, focusing on the pixelated 
                charm of MS Paint, the cozy world-building of Animal Crossing, and the simplicity of classic Nintendo games. 
                As an early 2000s child, I grew up expressing myself through digital art—creating drawings on MS Paint, sketching 
                on Flipnote Studio, and chatting through PictoChat on my Nintendo. These spaces felt limitless, offering 
                creativity unbounded by technical skill. Through this exhibition, I aim to evoke digital nostalgia, tapping 
                into a collective memory of childhood exploration and the joy of early online and gaming experiences.

            <p>This project beautifully taps into the nostalgic feeling of Animal Crossing, a game that defined many early 2000s childhood experiences.
                 It also bridges the gap between digital art creation in the game and real-world artistic practices, making it a perfect fit for the
                  theme of digital nostalgia.</p>

            <p>The Theresa Duncan CD-ROMs features three 90s feminist video games: Chop Suey, Smarty, and Zero Zero. These games broke away from typical “girls’ games” 
                by offering creative, interactive worlds. They tap into digital nostalgia, reviving early digital storytelling and childhood exploration through forgotten
                CD-ROMs now playable in a browser, fitting into the theme of digital nostalgia.</p>

            <p>This website was created as a sort of love letter to the older internet, featuring nostalgic graphics that aren't seen as frequently today. This fits 
                perfectly into the theme of digital nostalgia, reminding me of graphics I grew up with in the 2000s as a kid.</p>
